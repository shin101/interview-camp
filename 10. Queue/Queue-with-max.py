# Homework Problem 1 (Level: Hard)

# Maximum of Sliding Window: Given an array A and an integer K, find the maximum element in each sliding window of size K. For example:

# A = [4,6,5,2,4,7] and K = 3, windows are as follows:

# [4,6,5,2,4,7] : Max = 6
# [4,6,5,2,4,7] : Max = 6
# [4,6,5,2,4,7] : Max = 5
# [4,6,5,2,4,7] : Max = 7

# Output: 6,6,5,7

# Hint: You can do this in O(n) time, by using the Queue with Max we implemented above.

def maxSlidingWindow(nums, k):
    pass

# Test Case
print(maxSlidingWindow([1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7], 3)) # should output [3,3,5,5,6,7]
print(maxSlidingWindow([1], 1)) # should output [1]



# Solution
