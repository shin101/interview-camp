# Odd Even Linked List: Given a Linked List L, separate it into 2 Linked Lists. One contains L's odd nodes and the other contains L's even nodes. For example:

# Input: Head -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5

# Result 1: Head -> 1 -> 3 -> 5
# Result 2: Head -> 2 -> 4

# Note: Odd and Even here refer to the node's position, not value.
