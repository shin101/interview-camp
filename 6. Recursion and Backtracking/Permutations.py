# Coin Change Problem: Given a set of coin denominations, print out the different ways you can make a target amount. You can use as many coins of each denomination as you like.

# For example: If coins are [1,2,5] and the target is 5, output will be:

# [1,1,1,1,1]

# [1,1,1,2]

# [1,2,2]

# [5]

# Variant of this problem: If you had to print just the count (instead of the actual combinations), there is a more efficient solution in the Dynamic Programming Section. This solution is also acceptable though.
