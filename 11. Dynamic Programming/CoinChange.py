# Coin Change - Print Count: Given a set of coin denominations, print out the number of ways you can make a target amount. You can use as many coins of each denomination as you like.

# For example: If coins are [1,2,5] and the target is 5, the different ways are:

# [1,1,1,1,1]

# [1,1,1,2]

# [1,2,2]

# [5]

# The Output will be 4.
