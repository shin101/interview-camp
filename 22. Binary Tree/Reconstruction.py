# 105. Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal
# Medium

# Given two integer arrays preorder and inorder where preorder is the preorder traversal of a binary tree and inorder is the inorder traversal of the same tree, construct and return the binary tree.

# HINT 
# first value of preorder is guaranteed to be a root because thats how it works 
# everything to the left of root in inorder is on left subtree, everything on the right is on right subtree
